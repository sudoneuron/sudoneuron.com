Welcome to sudoneuron.com. This is the tiny little corner of the web that Telephone Jax calls home. This blog was created to both give the creator the opportunity to play around with Jekyll and GitHub Pages and to create a place where they can share their thoughts on random topics of probably no particular interest to anyone but themselves. If you have stumbled on this little blog, hello and welcome.
