![Film Poster for The Goonies (1985)](/img/TheGoonies.jpg)

In the fourth installment in the series of posts where I watch films along with *[Modern Technology Watches](https://modern.technology/)* with Rob Vincent (AKA [Rob T. Firefly](https://twitter.com/rob_t_firefly)) and [Gila Drazen](https://twitter.com/gilahava704) and then share my thoughts, I ***finally*** got around to watching the 1985 cult classic *The Goonies*. 

I have some interesting history around *The Goonies*. Growing up in Oregon (where the movie takes place and where it was filmed), it was a very popular film among kids I grew up around, and for a while I intended to check it out from my local Blockbuster Video in my youth but would always forget about it when seeking a movie to rent. Eventually I developed a weird sense of shame around even admitting that I hadn't seen the film, which somehow built up some perplexing psychological block around bringing myself to watch it. So now, finally, after a lifetime of unnecessary guilt and shame, I can finally count myself among those who have watched *The Goonies*! So how was it?

Well, I'm going to have to say it was not spectacular. Rob and Gila's commentary on it actually did a really good job of connecting with my feelings (I definitely was more in alignment with Gila on this one). I can see why the kids I grew up with like it, and there were definitely some problematic elements involving ableism and (nonstop) jokes about fat people made at the expense of an overweight child. Like Gila, I'm glad that I have finally gotten around to seeing it, but now that I've seen it, I don't see myself going out of my way to see it again.

For a full look at the plot you can check out the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goonies), or better yet, you can listen to Rob and Gila as they read over the plot summary and add their (often very funny) commentary to it.
