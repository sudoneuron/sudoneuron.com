In the second in a series of posts where I watch films along with *[Modern Technology Watches](https://modern.technology/)* with Rob Vincent (AKA [Rob T. Firefly](https://twitter.com/rob_t_firefly)) and [Gila Drazen](https://twitter.com/gilahava704) and then share my thoughts, I had the unfortunate opportunity to watch the 2007 so-called-comedy *The Ten*. Post-production Rob starts the episode of the podcast with a disclaimer stating "This episode is about a movie which has a very hard R-rating and it's based around what very many people would think of as offensive and adult humor. This movie contains heavy profanity, jokes about religious figures and concepts, death and disfigurement of adults and children, prison rape, STDs, and other such things." Rob fails to mention racism, but there is plenty of that present as well.

Rob and Gila both enjoyed this film and found it funny. I did not. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone and if it weren't for my dedication to watching all of the films this podcast covers, would have turned it off and given up on it long before it reached it's ending. While I admittedly haven't seen as many films as some other people, this film takes the honors of being one of the absolute worst films I have ever seen. I found it lacking in humor but overflowing with bad taste. In fact, the only positive thing I can say about this film is how good it feels to know that I will likely never have to be subjected to watching it ever again.

*The Ten* is a story—or rather a series of 10 interrelated stories—that are supposed to somehow tie in with the 10 Commandments found in the Jewish and Christian scriptures. The [Wikipedia page for the film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ten) gives a brief rundown of the 10 stories that make up the "plot" of the film, but at this point I'm going to end this blog post and just try to remove any remnants of this horrible film from my memory forever.
