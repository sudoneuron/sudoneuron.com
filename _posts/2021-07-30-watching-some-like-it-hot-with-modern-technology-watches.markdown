Episode 9 of season 1 of *[Modern Technology Watches](https://modern.technology/)* features Rob Vincent (AKA [Rob T. Firefly](https://twitter.com/rob_t_firefly)), [Gila Drazen](https://twitter.com/gilahava704), and special guest Susie Drazenâ€”Gila's mother. In this episode the three hosts watched and discussed the the classic 1959 film *Some Like It Hot*.

This was a film everyone involved in this endeavor (except me) had seen before. It was also a film everyone involved in this endeavor (including me) enjoyed. I always worry when watching older films just how much cringe I'm going to have to withstand; as the film premise began to become clear, I started to worry even more what kinds of awful misogyny and gender politics were going to reveal themselves. This was clearly a film from another era, and there were definitely views expressed that were more in alignment with when the film was made than we may have in the modern era, but it was all done in a way that I viewed as light-hearted and funny. I am not upset at all that I got the opportunity to watch *Some Like It Hot*.
