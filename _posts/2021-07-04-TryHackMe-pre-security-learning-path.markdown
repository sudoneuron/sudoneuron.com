At the beginning of July, [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) released a new Pre Security Learning Path. Since I have been working on the #100DaysOfHacking challenge and since [I recently completed the Complete Beginner Learning Path](https://sudoneuron.com/updates/2021-07-03-TryHackMe-complete-beginners-path-certificate.html), I decided to go through the Pre Security Learning Path as well. The material covered was all very simple introductory material and I found it incredibly easy, but for someone without any background in networks or the fundamentals of the web, I think this would be a good first step. The path also introduces fundamentals in Windows and Linux operating systems, but the courses are cross-overs from the Complete Beginner Learning Path so I had already completed them. Overall, it was a simple but fun experience
