In the episode 7 of season 1 of *[Modern Technology Watches](https://modern.technology/)*, Rob Vincent (AKA [Rob T. Firefly](https://twitter.com/rob_t_firefly)) and [Gila Drazen](https://twitter.com/gilahava704) watched and discussed *Josie and the Pussycats*. As you've probably deduced by now, so did I.

This podcast episode goes on a few tangents with some really fun discussions about [the time MTV tried to do a story on hackers and got pranked in the process](https://www.zdnet.com/article/mtv-made-to-look-ridiculous-by-fake-hacker/), a bit of history on [Moviefone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moviefone) (a service I remember well, which apparently still exists but no longer on the phone), and Gila's love for Alan Cumming. As for the discussion of *Josie and the Pussycats* itself, Gila loved it when it came out and still does; Rob on the other hand "hated this movie." 

I will admit that while I had never seen this film, I went into it expecting that, like Rob, I would also hate it. I also will admit that I never read the comics and until hearing that Rob didn't like the cartoon, had not even been aware that there was a cartoon that existed to not like. As an old punk that was playing in a band at the time, the music by the titular Josie and the Pussycats perfectly replicated everything about the radio-friendly made-for-the-masses bubblegum pop punk that was all the rage at the time of this film's release that I completely hated. DuJour, the film's stock boy band also perfectly captured the sound and aesthetic of everything I hated about that era's boy band craze. I thought the music (including the humerous "Back Door Lover" by the aforementioned DuJour), the contemporary pop culture references, the non-stop product placements (which were apparently not paid advertisements by any of the brands being advertised) and the occasional breaking of the fourth wall made for a hilarious movie. 

I thought*Josie and the Pussycats* did an amazing job at poking fun of pop culture, consumerism, and the music industry. A lot of the brilliant observations from the film were an astounding snapshot of the popular culture in 2001, but many are also just as relevent 20 years later as they were when this film was released. My dislike for the music only made the film better, and there are very few criticisms I can come up with for this movie. Sure it was predictable, campy, and a bit over the top, but all in a fun way. While I enjoyed *[Rocketman](ttps://sudoneuron.com/updates/2021/07/20/watching-rocketman-with-modern-technology-watches.html)*, *Josie and the Pussycats* really surprised me by being my favorite film I have watched for this project so far and it is definitely the first one that I would be happy to watch again sometime.
