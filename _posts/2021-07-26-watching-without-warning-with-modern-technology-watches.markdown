In the episode 8 of season 1 of *[Modern Technology Watches](https://modern.technology/)*, which happened to be a Halloween episode, Rob Vincent (AKA [Rob T. Firefly](https://twitter.com/rob_t_firefly)) and [Gila Drazen](https://twitter.com/gilahava704) watched and discussed the 1994 made-for-TV movie *Without Warning*.

*Without Warning* is a not-so-thingly veiled homage to Orson Welles 1938 radio dramatization of H.G. Wells' novel *War of the Worlds* ([Read more about that if somehow you're not familair with it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(1938_radio_drama)). This movie definitely felt like it came straight out of the 90s, which it of course did. The production reminded me a lot of the news media as I remember it growing up, and I love just about everything about this movie. My only complaint is that there were some pretty major time consistency issues; the movie is supposed to be live coverage of an event taking place as we're watching it, but at just around 40 minutes into the movie, the anchor says "an event that began some 95 minutes ago..." even though nowhere near 95 minutes had passed since the movie started, even accounting for commercials. That minor inconsistency and some other small time inconsistencies that I didn't catch but which Rob and Gila discuss in the podcast were small blemishes on what came off to me as an almost perfect production. Overall I really enjoyed this one a lot.
