For too long I have been planning to put together a simple web presence. This is that web presence. I plan to fill this space with thoughts about various things ranging from technology and hacker culture to my love for telephones (especially payphones), and whatever else sounds interesting to me at any given moment. This website was created in the spirit of the internet as it used to be, which is to say it is a platform for me to share my ideas and creations with no expectation of financial reward. You will find no sponsored posts, no ads, no paywalls, and no asks for monetary donations. Information wants to be free, and at sudoneuron.com it is!
