In the sixth episode of season 1 of *[Modern Technology Watches](https://modern.technology/)* with Rob Vincent (AKA [Rob T. Firefly](https://twitter.com/rob_t_firefly)) and [Gila Drazen](https://twitter.com/gilahava704) watched and discussed the 1979 cult classic *The Warriors*, and as a result, so did I. 

As I only came to realize at the very end of the *Modern Technology Watches* episode about this film, I apparently watched the director's cut instead of the theatrical release. To be fair to this film, there were some elements which I did enjoy; as a big fan of payphones, I liked the couple of brief scenes where old 1970s payphones were used; the soundtrack was pretty good; and I appreciated footage of the old New York subway system, which I have to admit I didn't realize wasn't entirely subterranean until seeing this film. I was also very bothered by the repeated use of homophobic slurs (specifically the use of the "F word"), the way that violence was portrayed as an acceptable normal usually free of any negative consequences, and the way that sexual assault was portrayed as just a thing that's okay to do. The film lacked any real storyline or character development, and with the already noted exceptions, was not something I found to be enjoyable to watch.
