A while back I committed to doing the #100DaysOfHacking challenge. I iniitally started working through the capture the flag challenges on [OverTheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/), but after 8 days of that I started working through various rooms on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). A few days ago (26 June, 2021), I earned my first certificate from TryHackMe.
