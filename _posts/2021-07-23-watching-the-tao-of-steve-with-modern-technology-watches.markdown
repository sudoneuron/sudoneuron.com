![Film Poster for The The Tao of Steve (2000)](/img/TheTaoOfSteve.jpg)

In the fifth installment in the series of posts where I watch films along with *[Modern Technology Watches](https://modern.technology/)* with Rob Vincent (AKA [Rob T. Firefly](https://twitter.com/rob_t_firefly)) and [Gila Drazen](https://twitter.com/gilahava704) and then share my thoughts, I watched the 2000  Sundance Film Festival award wining romantic comedy *The Tao of Steve*. 

As Rob and Gila point out, even though *The Tao of Steve* came out in 2000, it definitely feels like a 90s movie (but then again, coming out in 2000 means the writing and filmmaking probably happened in the 90s). I *almost* was able to appreciate the numerous references to religion and philosophy as someone that is interested in that sort of thing, if only it hadn't been so badly executed and if it didn't show what I viewed as a deeply flawed understanding of the ideas being discussed. I was *not* able to appreciate the fatphobia (just as I was unable to with *[The Goonies](https://sudoneuron.com/updates/2021/07/23/watching-the-goonies-with-modern-technology-watches.html)*) and the awful ways that human relationships were portrayed was definitely not a selling point for me. This wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, and I would have honestly probably enjoyed it to some extent when it came out, but times have changed and so have I. It was still **way** better than *[The Ten](https://sudoneuron.com/updates/2021/07/19/watching-the-ten-2007-with-modern-technology-watches.html)*!
